## Hi everyone this my first Machine Learning project-Cardekho_Price_Prediction.I predict the cars price with the Linear Regression Model.

Objective 1: Perform EDA and analyze this data to discover trends and provide your insights.
Objective 2: Identify and handle missing values, outliers or skewed variables if any. Convert categorical variables into numerical features using appropriate methods. 
Objective 3: After EDA and pre-processing, choose suitable variables from the dataset as per your analysis and use it to predict the price of a used car.

The above objective are solved and you can see in Cardekho_Price_prediction.ipynb.
