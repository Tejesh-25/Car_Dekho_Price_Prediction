## Hi everyone this my first Machine Learning project-Cardekho_Price_Prediction.I predict the cars price with the Linear Regression Model, KNeighborsRegressor,Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.

Objective 1: Perform EDA and analyze this data to discover trends and provide your insights.
Objective 2: Identify and handle missing values, outliers or skewed variables if any. Convert categorical variables into numerical features using appropriate methods. 
Objective 3: After EDA and pre-processing, choose suitable variables from the dataset as per your analysis and use it to predict the price of a used car.

The above objective are solved and you can see in Cardekho_Price_prediction.ipynb.

**Conclusion:**

**R^2 Score (Coefficient of Determination):**

The R^2 score is a measure of how well the model explains the variability in the target variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
An R^2 score of **0.80155** suggests that about **80.15%** of the variance in the target variable is explained by the RandomForestRegressor model. This is generally considered a good fit, as a higher R^2 score indicates a better-explained variance.

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**

MAE represents the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is a measure of the model's accuracy, and lower values are better.
A Mean Absolute Error of **127972** indicates, on average, the model's predictions are off by approximately **127972** **rupees** from the actual values.


**RandomForestRegressor model gives the best R^2 score value and loss is also minimum compare to other models.**
